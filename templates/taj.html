    <p>
        The Taj Mahal, an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra, India, is a breathtaking monument to love and loss. Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth in 1631, it is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful and romantic buildings in the world.
